\title{Recover the scope of a function that dies.}
\usage{
recover(fun, args, return.all = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{fun}{A function to test. Please supply as either an unquoted name, or
as a character string.}

\item{args}{A list of optional function arguments to evaluate the function with.}

\item{return.all}{Whether to return all of the objects in the environment, or to only
print the last function called (which failed).}
}
\value{
A list with the line caused the function to crash, and optionally the list of all
objects in scope when the crash happened. Alternatively print the failing line and return 1
 if **return.all** is set to **FALSE**. Return 0 if the function ran
succesfully (and print a message).
}
\description{
Allows error recovery with specific lines and functions.
}
\details{
This function exists due to difficulties in dealing with composed functions.
A composed function routinely returns an error message without listing the function
within that caused the error, leading to uninformative error messages. Rather
than try to rewrite everything that already exists (and works rather well), this
function allows you to evaluate everything that happened until the function crashed
and recover all of the objects in the environment when it crashed. You can thus reconstruct
the whole scenario and find the error message faster.

\examples{

 dummy_fun <- function( x = 2,
                        y = "this_crashes",
                        z = 2 )
 {
 # these will run
 x = x + 2
 z = x + 3
 # this will crash due to y being type character
 x = y + z
 return(x)
 }

 recover(fun = dummy_fun, args = list(x = 5))
 # this also works with arguments unspecified (but they must have set defaults)
 recover(fun = dummy_fun)
 # and it will try to be helpful, though it is recommended to specify args where possible

 # finally, recover can also return functions

dummy_fun <- function( x = 2 )
 {
 x = x + 2
 z = x + 3
 lister <- function() ls()
 stop()
 print("Hello, github!")
 return(x)
 }

 recover(fun = dummy_fun)
